# Web Development Project
A project on full-stack web development. The project implements a system for the registration of requests(emergency items) and the servicing of these needs in a community that affected by a natural disaster. Through the platform, a citizen can declare that they have specific needs for various items(e.g. water, food, medicine) or declare that they have a surplus and can donate specific items.

The technologies that were used are the following:
- **front-end:** HTML, Bootstrap(CSS), Javascript
- **back-end:** NodeJS
- **database:** MySQL

The user types of the system are the following:
- **admin:** This user is responsible for managing the warehouse of a base. He is also responsible for creating announcements about emergency items and he can create new rescuers accounts
- **rescuer:** This user owns a vehicle and he is responsible for gathering and distributing the emergency items to the citizens
- **citizen:** This user can donate or request emergency items
